# tweet-generator

This script generates photos of fictional tweets. The input is a .csv file called "new.csv" that contains a few piece of information: 
  1) the username 
  2) the day of the tweet
  3) the month of the tweet
  4) the year of the tweet
  5) the tweet text
  
The script handles the rest, finding the user's screen name and giving the tweet a random yet believable number of engagement metrics

Upon launching the tool in the terminal, you are presented with a few different options:
  1) an option to generate and download all tweets
  2) an option to download all profile pictures and import to a folder called "profpics"
  3) an option to generate and download the tweet of a single user in the spreadsheet
  4) an option to download the profile picture of a single user in the spreadsheet
  
There are a few things required in addition to running the script, which are all machine-dependent:
  1) a "profpics" folder. All instances of this folder in the script must be updated for you specific machine
  2) altering lines of code for clicking and downlaoding. This includes finding the correct coordinates on your screen for clicking the tweet image
     and saving it on your machine
